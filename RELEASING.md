# Publishing releases

A version tag publishes a release. The `release.yml` workflow does the rest, in the order the MCP Registry requires.

## Before tagging

1. Bump the version in `package.json`, `server.json` (both `version` fields) and `PACKAGE_VERSION` in `src/server.ts`. The test suite fails when they disagree.
2. Add a `## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD` section to `CHANGELOG.md`. The workflow uses it as the GitHub release notes and stops if it is missing.
3. Update the README (What's new, the install tag, upgrade notes, tool counts) and regenerate `server-card.json` with `npm run catalog`.
4. Merge the reviewed change into `main` after CI succeeds.

## Tagging

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Pushing the tag starts **Release**. It checks out the tag, runs `npm ci`, the runtime dependency audit, the typecheck, the build and the tests, and checks that the tag equals the `package.json` version. Then it:

1. publishes the package to npm with provenance, through npm trusted publishing (no npm token is stored in the repository);
2. creates the GitHub release for the tag from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section and marks it as Latest;
3. publishes `server.json` to the MCP Registry, authenticated with the `getmcpads.com` DNS key in the `MCP_DNS_PRIVATE_KEY` secret.

The registry reads `mcpName` from the published npm package, which is why npm comes first.

## Rerunning a partial release

Each step skips when its target already holds the version, so rerunning is safe. Run **Release** from the Actions tab with the existing tag, such as `v2.1.0`, to finish a release that stopped part way.

## One-time setup

- npm: the `@getmcpads/tiktok-ads-mcp-server` package needs a trusted publisher on npmjs.com that points at this repository and the workflow file `release.yml`.
- MCP Registry: the repository needs the `MCP_DNS_PRIVATE_KEY` secret for the `getmcpads.com` domain.

The README install commands select a tag from the GitHub source. The npm package and the MCP Registry entry come from the same workflow run, after the tag exists.
