The film shows hosted getmcpads with sample data. Its MCP Apps, from creative galleries and alerts to Google Sheets exports and bulk launches, belong to the hosted product. This repository provides the standalone native API tools.

**35 read tools** · **29 write tools**, disabled by default.

Run locally with your own platform credentials and a client that supports stdio MCP, such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code or Cursor. Your requests go directly to the platform. For managed connections, including supported ChatGPT setups, use the hosted option.

## What's new

**[v2.0.1: Native tools and security update](https://github.com/get-mcp-ads/tiktok-ads-mcp-server/releases/tag/v2.0.1) · September 20, 2026**

- Preserve exact unquoted 64-bit IDs in read, write and verification responses.
- Fix campaign field selection and default list limits.
- Update native write validation for budgets, schedules, targeting and readback. Add carousel music, uploaded-video readiness, CTA portfolio and custom identity tools.
- Require Node.js 22.12 or newer and check Node 22/24 in CI.
- Update vulnerable dependencies and regenerate the MCP catalog.

[Full changelog](CHANGELOG.md) · [Source synchronization details](SOURCE_SYNC.md) · [All releases](https://github.com/get-mcp-ads/tiktok-ads-mcp-server/releases)

### Upgrade notes

Requires **Node.js 22.12 or newer**. CI covers Node 22 and 24. Version 2.0.1 drops Node 18 and 20 support. Read the current tool schemas before reusing saved arguments. Writes remain optional and require explicit confirmation. Hosted creative integrations and MCP Apps UI are outside this release.

## Install this release

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **35 read tools** | Campaigns, ad groups, ads, creatives, audiences, pixels, events, Spark Ads, catalogs, delivery diagnostics |
| **29 write tools** | Off by default. Campaign and ad group status, budgets, campaign creation. Each one **previews before it applies** |
| **277 metrics** | Including derived ones computed client-side |
| **16 dimensions** | With a compatibility matrix that catches invalid combinations before they hit the API |
| **5 resources** | Live catalogues the model can read: metrics, dimensions, compatibility rules, 12 workflow recipes |
| **Keyword research** | `tiktok_search_keywords` and `tiktok_get_search_ads_maturity`, for TikTok Search Ads |
| **Forward-compatible reads** | `tiktok_get_read_endpoint`, `tiktok_get_entities_raw`, `tiktok_get_report_raw` reach endpoints this server doesn't model yet |

### The query planner

TikTok rejects many metric and dimension combinations, and its error messages rarely say why.
This server encodes the compatibility matrix, so it **splits an impossible request into
several valid API calls and merges the results** instead of failing.

`tiktok_validate_query` lets the model check a combination before spending a call on it.

### One trap this server handles for you

**TikTok answers HTTP 200 even when the call failed.** The applicative `code` field is what
decides. A client that trusts the HTTP status reports imaginary successes back to the model,
which then reasons on data that was never returned. Every call here checks `code` first.

---

## Getting a token

TikTok needs **two** values, not one: an access token and the App ID it belongs to.

1. Create a developer app on the [TikTok for Business developer portal](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal).
2. Note the **App ID** and App Secret from the app's page.
3. Authorize the advertiser accounts you want to reach. TikTok grants access per advertiser,
   so an account you skip here stays invisible to the server no matter what the token allows.
4. Complete the OAuth authorization flow to exchange the returned `auth_code` for an
   **access token**. TikTok's long-lived tokens do not expire on a fixed schedule, but they
   are revoked when the authorization is withdrawn.
5. Put the token in `TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` and the App ID in `TIKTOK_APP_ID`.

📖 [TikTok API for Business documentation](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs)

Run **`tiktok_health_check`** as your first call. It verifies the credentials, lists the
advertiser accounts you can actually reach, and reports what is missing, without printing
your token.

### Which permissions?

| Scope group | When you need it |
|---|---|
| Reporting and read scopes | **Always.** Campaigns, ad groups, ads, insights |
| Campaign management scopes | Only if you set `TIKTOK_ENABLE_WRITES=1` |
| Catalog and Business Center scopes | Optional, for `tiktok_get_shop_catalog_diagnostics` |

---

## Setup

### Claude Desktop

`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS)
or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tiktok-ads": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@getmcpads/tiktok-ads-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token-here",
        "TIKTOK_APP_ID": "your-app-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Ask it: *"list my TikTok advertiser accounts"*.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add tiktok-ads --env TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token --env TIKTOK_APP_ID=your-app-id -- npx -y @getmcpads/tiktok-ads-mcp-server
```

### Cursor

`.cursor/mcp.json` in your project, same shape as the Claude Desktop config above.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/get-mcp-ads/tiktok-ads-mcp-server.git
cd tiktok-ads-mcp-server
npm install && npm run build
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your credentials
npm start
```

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` | none | **Required.** Your access token |
| `TIKTOK_APP_ID` | none | **Required.** The App ID the token belongs to |
| `TIKTOK_APP_SECRET` | none | Optional, for endpoints needing app authentication |
| `TIKTOK_ADVERTISER_ID` | none | Optional default, saves passing it on every call |
| `TIKTOK_BC_ID` | none | Optional Business Center ID |
| `TIKTOK_ENABLE_WRITES` | *unset* | Set to `1` to register the 29 write tools |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

Check your setup at any time:

```bash
npm run doctor
```

---

## Writes, and why they preview first

Write tools are **disabled by default**. Enable them with `TIKTOK_ENABLE_WRITES=1`.

When enabled, every write tool returns a preview and changes nothing:

```jsonc
// tiktok_update_adgroup_budget { advertiserId: "7...", adGroupId: "1...", budget: 50 }
{
  "applied": false,
  "action": "tiktok_update_adgroup_budget",
  "change": { "advertiser": "7...", "adGroup": "1...", "newBudget": 50,
              "budgetMode": "BUDGET_MODE_DAY" },
  "message": "Preview only, nothing was changed. Repeat the same call with confirm: true to apply this change to the live account."
}
```

Only a second call carrying `confirm: true` touches the live account.

This is deliberate. An assistant composes these calls, and it can pick the wrong advertiser,
the wrong campaign, or the wrong order of magnitude on a budget. A mandatory preview makes the
mistake visible before it costs money, and gives a human the stopping point the protocol does
not guarantee on its own.

One further guardrail: **`tiktok_create_campaign` always creates the campaign `DISABLE`.**
There is no option to create it running.

| Tool | What it changes |
|---|---|
| `tiktok_update_campaign_status` / `tiktok_update_adgroup_status` | Pause or reactivate |
| `tiktok_update_campaign_budget` / `tiktok_update_adgroup_budget` | Budget, in the account currency |
| `tiktok_create_campaign` | Creates a campaign, always `DISABLE` |

## Security

The server holds a credential that can read, and optionally modify, live ad accounts.
Concretely:

- **The token is never logged.** Debug output prints `Access-Token: [redacted]`.
- **Requests go only to `business-api.tiktok.com`**, and only under `/open_api/v1.3/`.
  Any other host or path is refused rather than called. *Covered by tests.*
- **Redirects are refused once a token is attached**, so a redirect cannot forward your
  credential elsewhere.
- **Mutating and OAuth endpoints are blocked on the generic read paths.** *Covered by tests.*
- **No telemetry.** The server makes no network call other than to the TikTok Business API.
  You can verify this by grepping the source for `fetch`.

Every tool declares read/write annotations, parameter descriptions and a structured output schema. Successful calls expose the payload as `structuredContent.result`; errors retain `isError: true`. The generated [server card](server-card.json) contains definitions only.

Run `npm run bundle -- /path/to/output` to build a `.mcpb` desktop bundle from the current catalog. Credentials are entered locally during installation. Write tools remain disabled unless explicitly enabled.
